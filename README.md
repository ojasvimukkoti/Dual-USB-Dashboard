Example dashboard script that shows visualizations for ATP testing reports for Dual USBs at Amphenol PCD. Meant to highlight why the dual USB products were failing when ATP test was conducted. 
Developed dashboard at my first co-op at Amphenol PCD. 

**DualUSB_Dashboard.py** is the dashboard script.

**ConvertClass.py** is a class that helps automate the process of going through a directory that has the Dual USB data and condenses it to a big CSV that contains necessary data for the dashboard.
